Historical horse population in Canada
================

Aim
---

This project explores the historical population of horses in Canada between 1906 and 1972 for each Province.

Data
----

Horse population data were sourced from the [Government of Canada's Open Data website](http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data). Specifically, these two sources were used:

-   [Horses, number on farms at June 1 and at December 1](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/43b3a9b3-3842-45e7-8bc8-c4c27b9462ab)
-   [Horses, number on farms at June 1, farm value per head and total farm value](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/b374f60b-9580-44dc-83f6-c0a850c15f30)

We can see from the visualisation above that Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta have had the highest horse populations in Canada. All provinces have had a decline in horse populations since 1940. This is likely due to the rebound of the Canadian automotive industry after the Great Depression and the Second World War. An interesting follow-up visualization would be car sales per year for each Province over the time period visualised above to further support this hypothesis.
